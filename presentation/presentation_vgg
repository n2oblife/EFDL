VGG, which stands for "Visual Geometry Group," is a popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford in 2014. It was one of the first deep learning models to achieve state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet dataset, a large benchmark for image classification and object recognition.

VGG is known for its simple, yet effective architecture. It consists of multiple convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by a few fully connected (dense) layers. The key feature of VGG is the use of very small convolutional filters, typically 3x3, which allows for more depth in the network and a better representation of the input image. The model also uses a large number of filters in each layer, which helps capture different aspects of the image.

In terms of implementation, VGG can be easily created using PyTorch's neural network library. To create a VGG model, you can use the nn module to define the layers of the network and the functional module to define the forward pass. The forward pass of a VGG model typically consists of a series of convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by a few fully connected (dense) layers.

Overall, VGG is a simple yet powerful CNN architecture that has stood the test of time and remains widely used in many computer vision tasks today. I hope this helps you with your presentation! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.
